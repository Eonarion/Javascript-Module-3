1. In your own words, describe what JavaScript Code Style is.

	Not sure I understand the question, but I will try to answer.
	Javascript Code Style is to try to make the code look neat,

	coder or developer, they can quickly and efficiently find
	out how the code works, what it does, and how to change it.

8. What is minifying JavaScript Code?

	Minifying Javascript Code means removing everything
	technically unecessary for the code to run, like whitespace
	and similar details, which computers "ignores"
	but makes it easier for us humans to read the code.
	Can make code/the website run faster, but makes it
	much more difficult for humans to read the code.


9. What is a global variable?

	A global variable is a variable with global scope, 
	meaning its accessible outside of and to all of 
	(in JS;) the functions.
